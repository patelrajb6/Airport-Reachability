# Airport-Reachability
Program which uses Graph Data structure implemented using adjacency list

We first insert airports into the adjaceny list and do various functions

The commands for this project are:
  q      // quit the program
  ?      //help with commands
  #       
  t <int1> <int2>    //Depth first search to check if the we can go from 1 airport to other
  r <int>     //resize adjacency list by <int>
  i <int1> <int2>     //insert path from airport 1 to other
  d <int1> <int2>    //delete path from 1 to 2
  l                 //shows the adjacency list
  f <filename>    //takes input of file and runs commands on them
  s <int1> <int2>  //uses Breadth first search to find the shortest path and prints the path
